## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- A detailed description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

### Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/issues) to see if someone else has suggested it. If not, feel free to create a new issue with:
- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed explanation of the feature
- How it will benefit the project and its users
